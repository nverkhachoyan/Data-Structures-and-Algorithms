# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository!

In this repo, you will find implementations of various data structures and algorithms, written in C++. These implementations are meant to be educational and are not intended for production use.

Currently, the following data structures and algorithms have been implemented:

Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort
Search algorithms: linear search, binary search
Data structures: linked list, stack, queue, tree
More data structures and algorithms will be added in the future.

If you have any suggestions for data structures or algorithms that you would like to see implemented, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I hope that these implementations will be useful for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and algorithms.

Thank you for visiting!
