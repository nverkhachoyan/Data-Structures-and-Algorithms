# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts a list by building up the sorted part one element at a time. It works by iterating through the list and inserting each element in its correct position in the sorted list, making it a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

### How it works

Insertion sort works by dividing the list into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. The algorithm iterates through the list and for each element, it compares it with the elements in the sorted portion to determine its correct position in the sorted list. It then inserts the element in its correct position and increases the size of the sorted portion by one. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.
