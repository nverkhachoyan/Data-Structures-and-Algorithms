# Bubble Sort

This is an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm for sorting a list of items. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through the list of items, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process until the list is sorted.

One of the main advantages of bubble sort is that it is easy to understand and implement. However, it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm and is generally not used in practice for large lists.
